A casual arcade game inspired by Stacky Bird, developed in Unity. The player
controls a bird that collects blocks to build a vertical stack and uses the
stack to pass through obstacles and reach the finish platform.

## Features
- One-tap control system
- Block collection and vertical stacking mechanic
- Stack height used to clear obstacles
- Obstacle collision and stack reduction
- Level-based progression
- Win and lose conditions
- Simple and responsive UI

## Tech Stack
- Unity
- C#
- Rigidbody Physics
- Unity UI (Canvas)

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Casual mobile game mechanics
- Stack management and height-based gameplay logic
- Obstacle interaction and collision handling
- Game state and level flow management
- Clean and modular gameplay code

## Platform
- Android

## How to Play
1. Tap to move the bird forward
2. Collect blocks to increase the stack height
3. Use the stack to pass through obstacles
4. Reach the finish platform to complete the level

## How to Run
1. Open the project in Unity
2. Select the target platform (Android or PC)
3. Build and run the project
4. Start a level and play

## Note
This project is a gameplay demo created to showcase stack-based mechanics and
casual mobile game flow. Visual assets are used for demonstration purposes
