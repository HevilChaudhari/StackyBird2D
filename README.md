# Stack Bird 2D (Unity)

A 2D casual arcade game developed in Unity where the player taps the screen to
spawn blocks below the bird. The stacked blocks help the bird gain height to
clear obstacles and complete the level.

## Features
- One-tap control system
- Block spawning below the bird on screen tap
- Vertical stacking mechanic
- Stack height used to clear obstacles
- Obstacle collision and stack reduction
- Level-based progression
- Win and lose conditions
- Simple and responsive UI

## Tech Stack
- Unity
- C#
- 2D Physics
- Unity UI (Canvas)

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Tap-based input handling
- Runtime block spawning and stacking logic
- Height-based obstacle clearance mechanics
- Collision handling in 2D
- Level flow and game state management

## Platform
- Android
